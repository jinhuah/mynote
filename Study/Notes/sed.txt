$ cat input
abc
123%

abc%
this is 456% and nothing more
456
Use sed -n -E 's/(^|.*[^0-9])([0-9]{1,3})%.*/\2/p' input

$  sed  -n -E 's/(^|.*[^0-9])([0-9]{1,3})%.*/\2/p' input
123
456
The -n flag makes sed to suppress automatic output of the lines. Then, we use the -E flag which will allow us to use extended regular expressions. (In GNU sed, the flag is not -E but instead is -r).

Now comes the s/// command. The group (^|.*[^0-9]) matchs either a beginning of line (^) or a series of zero or more chars (.*) ending in a non-digit char ([^0-9]). [0-9]\{1,3\} just matches one to three digits and is bound to a group (by the ( and ) group delimiters) if the group is preceded by (^|.*[^0-9]) and followed by %. Then .* matches everything before and after this pattern. After this, we replace everything by the second group (([0-9]{1,3})) using the backreference \2. Since we passed -n to sed, nothing would be printed but we passed the p flag to the s/// command. The result is that if the replacement is executed then the resulted line is printed. Note the p is a flag of s///, not the p command, because it comes just after the last /.
