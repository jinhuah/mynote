Saiku 2.4 UI Bug Report

1. "Add new folder" button will disapear when you click a saved query in Repository.

2. When a folder name contains a space, the folder can be created but cannot be deleted.

3. "Non-empty" button is not functional reliably. It has to be clicked several times to get non-empty output.
